Introduction

There are many interesting facts and conversations around video games, everything from populatiry to profitablity. Video games as we know them have been around since the 1950's and as the community of data science focused engineers grow, we begin see the affect of video games on our communities (how many players we have to compete with, ha).

As an avid player (Mr and Mrs Pacman and Galaga) I have always wondered how well the products have faired in the market place. You may have your own viewpoint- but what does the data suggest. The future development of applicaitons and video games alike is based on data such as the sales/interest. That is, if the game is popular it will sale.

Therefore, I used the underlying data provided in the Kaggle study to take a closer look.

The data set contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies, as realized on vgchartz.com. Overall, approximately 16 thousand records were collected to round out the dataset that has attributed to the following questions:

Question 1: Understand how Video game Platform sales are performing by total sales in each region

Here you can see as you move from left to right the video game popularity (by the game platform), based on the sales per region. The clears leader are the PS2, XBOX and the PS3.

A little more than 14% of Platforms are PS2 while X360, PS3 and WII round out around 10%.

The overall data is aggregated by platform with the sums of each sales region. The data is then represented in the graph abmove.





Question 2: Understand how video games are distributed across different Genre's

In the chart below, I was interested in understanding the distribution of game sales based on genre. THe thought here is see where i fit into the overall model (knowing i like the strategy games like Pacman and Galaga, where do fall relative to other users).

Much like action movies, action video games appear to provide the foundation to the generous sales.

Question 3: Predict the Platform sales based on sales reportings

Finally, I wondered if there might be bias related to specifc video game platforms suggesting the sales for a specifc region.

In order to take a closer look at this, I divided the data into two groups. One of the groups was a group that referred to each of the sales regions of interest and the other of the various video game platforms.

Here, we can see that the projection of overall sales it set to increase.

Conclusion

In this article, we took a look at how to break into the field of becoming a developer according to Stack Overflow 2017 survey data.

1) From the visual representation above we can see that PS2 has outsold all other platforms.

2) From the visual represenation above we can determine that the Genre Action leads in popularity.

3) Using the visual represenation above we can see the predicted sales, trending upward.

The findings here are observational, not the result of a formal study. So the real question remains:
