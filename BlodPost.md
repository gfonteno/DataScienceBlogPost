## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The project is using the following Python Libraries Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Sklearn

The code should run using Python versions 3.*

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Video Game Sales data that have more than 100,000 copies distributed to better understand:

1. Understand how Video game Platform sales are performing by total sales in each region
2. Understand how video games are distributed across different Genre's
3. Predict the Platform sales based on sales reportings


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for the individual steps.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).
